/**
 * Project Blinkenlights -- Main Program
 *
 * RGB LED strip controller with an LCD, rotary encoder with push button and
 * one more button.
 *
 * The device is built of the following components:
 *  - TI MSP430 LaunchPad Rev. 1.5 with an MSP430G2553
 *  - custom BoosterPack add-on board to host all additional electronics
 *     - 12V RGB LED strip (via connector)
 *     - 12V power supply
 *     - 12V -> 5V and 5V -> 3.3V LDO
 *     - 4x20 LCD display
 *     - rotary encoder with push button
 *     - additional button
 *
 * The whole function is accomplished with two parts:
 *  - int main()
 *  - timer ISR
 *
 * The main() has a loop which enters LPM0 at its start. Note that LPM1 saves
 * more power by deactivating the DCO and its DC generator, but only if it is
 * not used for SMCLK. Since we use SMCLK for the timer, LPM1 is identical to
 * LPM0.
 *
 * From this low-power mode the main loop is woken up by the timer ISR, if
 * something has to be done. All main functionality is then performed by
 * main(). So, there are three reasons for the ISR to wakeup main():
 *  - rotary encoder was rotated
 *  - a button was pressed
 *  - a timeout was reached
 *
 * The timers are additionally used to generate PWMs for the LEDs (see
 * init_timer()):
 *  - Timer A0 is used with CCR1 to generate a PWM for the LCD backlight.
 *  - Timer A1 is used with a trick so that all three CCRs including CCR0
 *    can be used for PWMs for the RGB LED strip.
 *
 * Timer A1 is setup to count the full 16 bit register and overflow after
 * 0xFFFF. Upon each overflow, an ISR is executed. With the Sub-main clock
 * SMCLK = 16MHz this results in 244.14Hz interrupt rate = 4.096 ms periode.
 *
 * Timeouts:
 * ---------
 * Global variables counted downward in the timer ISR. It reaching 0, the
 * main() is notified.
 *
 * Rotary Encoder:
 * ---------------
 * The NOBLE RE0124 rotary encoder has 24 steps per 360Â° rotation plus a push
 * button. The rotation causes two switches to close and therefore connect the
 * terminals A and B to GND. The MSP430 GPIO pins used have the pull-ups
 * activated. The two inputs are summarized by the macro ROTENC_PHASE. At the
 * detent positions, both switches are open, so 0x03 is seen. When rotating
 * clock-wise, first terminal A goes to 0, so 0x02 is seen. When rotating
 * counter-clock-wise, first terminal B goes to 0, so 0x01 is seen. These two
 * values are used to identify rotation direction.
 *
 * The rotation speed is identified using the upward counter variable
 * RotEncCount in the ISR. The further this value has counted, the slower the
 * rotation was.
 *
 * When the user turns the knob, the direction (and speed) is communicated to
 * main() by setting RotEncValue to a non-zero value (positive or negative)
 * and LPM0 is exited after the ISR, so main() can handle the user input.
 *
 * Buttons:
 * --------
 * The rotary encoder also has a push button (if the knob is pushed).
 * Additionally, an extra button is soldered to the PCB. Both are normally
 * open and connect the signal wire to GND when pressed. The MSP430 GPIO pins
 * are configured to apply an internal pull-up.
 *
 * The current state of each button is stored as bits in the variable
 * ButtonValue. The old state is also stored in this variable by a shift-left
 * of the old state. Therefore a rising and falling edge can easily be
 * detected.
 *
 * When the user has pressed one of these buttons, LPM0 is exited after the
 * ISR, so main() can handle the user input.
 *
 * LCD Backlight Fade-In/-Out:
 * ---------------------------
 * All time-dependent functions like the fade-in/-out of the LCD backlight
 * LED PWM need the help of the timer interrupt. From main() the order to
 * fade-in/-out the PWM is communicated to the ISR via the variable
 * LedLcdFade. Its value is added (signed!) to the variable LedLcdBacklight
 * and saturated to 0 and 0xFFFF. Its value is then converted via a
 * non-linear transfer function to the PWM value.
 *
 * Rainbow:
